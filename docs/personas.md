# User Personas

This document defines the six primary user personas for Helm, structured around the governance and delivery roles defined in AXELOS frameworks (P3O, MSP, MoP, PRINCE2). Each persona is informed by both framework definitions and current job market research.

---

## Governance / Oversight Roles

These roles focus on strategic direction, investment decisions, and accountability for outcomes. They need visibility and decision support rather than day-to-day management tools.

---

### 1. Portfolio Steering Board Chair

**Also known as:** Investment Committee Chair, Portfolio Direction Group (PDG) Chair

**AXELOS reference:** MoP — Portfolio Direction Group

**Seniority:** Executive / Board level

#### Primary Goals

- Ensure the change portfolio delivers strategic value and aligns with organisational objectives
- Make evidence-based investment decisions: approve, adjust, or terminate programmes
- Maintain confidence that the organisation is investing in the right initiatives
- Provide clear direction when conflicts arise between competing priorities

#### Key Frustrations

- Receives inconsistent, stale, or overly optimistic reporting — cannot trust the numbers
- Spends board time establishing basic facts rather than making strategic decisions
- Lacks visibility into cross-programme dependencies and portfolio-level risk exposure
- Decisions are made without clear line-of-sight to costs incurred vs benefits delivered
- No early warning system — problems surface only when they've become crises

#### Typical Workflow

| Frequency | Activities |
|-----------|------------|
| Monthly/Quarterly | Chairs portfolio board meetings; reviews portfolio health dashboard |
| Ad hoc | Approves major investment decisions, stage gates, programme closures |
| Ongoing | Receives escalations requiring executive decision; resolves cross-programme conflicts |

#### Helm Capabilities That Matter Most

| Capability | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Portfolio dashboard** | Single view of portfolio health without relying on manually assembled packs |
| **EVM visibility** | Cost/schedule/benefit data to support timely intervention decisions |
| **Escalation tracking** | Clear audit trail of what was escalated, when, and how it was resolved |
| **Cross-programme dependencies** | Visibility into how programmes affect each other |

#### Success Metrics

- Time from "issue identified" to "decision made" reduces
- Fewer surprises at board meetings — issues surfaced before they become crises
- Confidence in data quality — board spends time deciding, not debating the numbers
- Portfolio delivers higher proportion of planned benefits

---

### 2. Programme Sponsor (SRO)

**Also known as:** Senior Responsible Owner, Executive Sponsor

**AXELOS reference:** MSP — Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)

**Seniority:** Senior executive / Director level

#### Primary Goals

- Ensure the programme delivers its objectives and realises projected benefits
- Maintain a viable business case throughout the programme lifecycle
- Provide visible leadership and clear accountability for the change
- Broker relationships with senior stakeholders and secure ongoing commitment

#### Key Frustrations

- Accountable for outcomes but lacks real-time visibility into programme health
- Relies on programme manager's reports — often discovers problems too late
- Unclear how programme benefits connect to strategic objectives
- Governance meetings consume time but don't surface actionable insights
- Difficult to demonstrate programme value to the board or Portfolio Direction Group

#### Typical Workflow

| Frequency | Activities |
|-----------|------------|
| Weekly | Reviews programme status; available for ad hoc decisions and guidance |
| Fortnightly/Monthly | Chairs or attends programme board; reviews business case viability |
| Stage gates | Approves progression to next tranche; confirms benefits realisation on track |
| Ad hoc | Escalation point for issues beyond programme manager's authority |

#### Helm Capabilities That Matter Most

| Capability | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Programme health dashboard** | Confidence in status without micromanaging the programme manager |

| **Risk/issue escalation** | Early warning of items requiring SRO attention or decision |
| **Audit trail** | Evidence of governance decisions for assurance and accountability |
| **OKR traceability** | Demonstrates programme contribution to strategic objectives |

#### Success Metrics

- No "surprise" escalations to Portfolio Direction Group — issues handled at programme level
- Business case remains current and defensible throughout programme
- Benefits realised as forecast (or variances explained and accepted)
- Stakeholder confidence maintained — programme seen as well-governed

---

## Operational / Delivery Roles

These roles focus on planning, execution, and reporting. They need tools to manage work, track progress, and communicate status upward while maintaining governance standards.

---
