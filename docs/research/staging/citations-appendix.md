## Source Reliability Notes

| Source Type | Examples in Table | Reliability Assessment |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **IDC** (#1) | Market sizing ($6.5B) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Gold standard for software market sizing. Uses vendor-reported financials (bottom-up), not survey-based estimation. Most defensible figure for investor-grade claims. |
| **Mordor Intelligence / Grand View Research** (#2, #3) | Enterprise/SME split | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Established market research firms. Mordor uses primary + secondary research; GVR uses survey-based top-down. Both independently corroborate the ~60/40 split — strong convergent validity. |
| **Apps Run The World** (#4) | Top 10 vendor share | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Specialist software market tracker. Vendor share data derived from public filings and estimates. Published Sept 2025 — recent. |
| **Vendor product pages** (#5–#8) | Meeting-to-action gap verification | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Primary sources — first-party vendor documentation of their own AI features. Absence of a feature on the vendor's own product page is strong evidence the feature doesn't exist. |
| **Expert review sites** (#10, #12) | Acuity PPM, CPO Club | ⭐⭐⭐ Domain-specialist reviewers with PPM expertise. Opinions are informed but editorial — stronger than user anecdotes, weaker than primary research. |
| **Reddit r/projectmanagement** (#9, #11, #13) | User complaints (RAID, Smartsheet, dependencies) | ⭐⭐ Anecdotal but representative. Individual user experiences, not statistically sampled. Value is in the specificity of complaints — real practitioners describing real pain points. Volume of similar complaints across threads strengthens the signal. |
| **Wellingtone** (#14–#16) | PMO surveys (42% manual reports, paradox) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ UK-focused PMO survey with hundreds of respondents. Annual publication with longitudinal data (2021–2025). Well-regarded in the PM practitioner community. Not peer-reviewed academic research but the closest equivalent for PMO-specific data. |
| **PMI** (#17) | AI adoption (82% senior leaders) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Project Management Institute — the global professional body for project management. Large-sample surveys (~2,800+ respondents for Pulse reports). The most authoritative source for PM profession statistics. |
| **Regulatory bodies** (#18, #19) | FCA PS21/3, DORA Article 6 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Primary legislative/regulatory sources. Undisputable — these are the actual regulations with defined compliance requirements and deadlines. |
| **LangGraph / Firecrawl** (#20) | Framework adoption data | ⭐⭐⭐ PyPI download data is objective and verifiable. Case study (Klarna) is vendor-published — treat as marketing-supported rather than independently verified. The 4.2M figure is from a third-party comparison (Firecrawl), adding a layer of corroboration. |
