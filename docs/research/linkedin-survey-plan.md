# Helm Market Validation — LinkedIn Survey Plan
> Drafted 30 January 2026

## Strategy: Two-Tier Approach

### Tier 1: LinkedIn Polls (reach + engagement)
- 4 options max per poll
- Run 3 polls over 2 weeks
- Each poll stands alone but builds a narrative
- Purpose: Signal detection + algorithm engagement + credibility building

### Tier 2: Deeper Survey (Google Form)
- Linked from each poll post + Bry's profile
- 8-10 questions, ~3 minutes to complete
- Purpose: Quantified validation data for feature prioritisation and pricing

## Tier 1: LinkedIn Poll Sequence

### Poll 1 — The Pain Point (Week 1)
**Post text:**
> After 8+ years running PMOs across financial services, government, and healthcare, I've noticed the same pattern everywhere:
>
> We invest heavily in project management tools — but governance still lives in spreadsheets, emails, and someone's memory.
>
> Quick poll for my PMO/programme management network:
>
> **What's your biggest governance headache?**

**Poll options:**
1. Decisions made but never tracked/traceable
2. RAID items lost between meetings
3. Reporting takes days to compile
4. Escalations unclear — who owns what?

**Hashtags:** #PMO #ProgrammeManagement #Governance #ProjectManagement #P3O

---

### Poll 2 — The Tool Gap (Week 1, Day 4)
**Post text:**
> The responses to my last poll confirmed what I suspected — governance is the gap nobody's solved well.
>
> So here's the follow-up: what are you actually using for portfolio/programme governance right now?
>
> (Not project management — I mean governance: decision logs, RAID tracking, escalation chains, board reporting)
>
> **Your governance tool is:**

**Poll options:**
1. Spreadsheets / SharePoint (the honest answer)
2. Part of our PPM tool (Planview, ServiceNow, etc.)
3. Homegrown / cobbled together
4. We don't really have one

**Hashtags:** #PMO #Governance #PPM #PortfolioManagement #DigitalTransformation

---

### Poll 3 — The AI Question (Week 2)
**Post text:**
> Final question in my governance mini-series (thank you for all the engagement!).
>
> Every PPM vendor is adding "AI-powered" to their marketing. But I'm genuinely curious — is AI even what your PMO needs right now?
>
> **Where would AI help your PMO most — if at all?**

**Poll options:**
1. Speed up routine admin (reports, updates, chasing)
2. Capture decisions & actions from meetings automatically
3. Predict which projects are likely to slip
4. Honestly, better AI isn't what we need right now

> *Note: Options deliberately include non-governance AI use cases and a null hypothesis to avoid confirmation bias. If option 2 leads, it's a genuine signal for Helm's meeting-to-governance pipeline. If option 4 leads, it's a genuine warning that AI isn't the purchase driver.*

**Hashtags:** #AI #PMO #Governance #FutureOfWork #ArtificialIntelligence

## Tier 2: Google Form Survey

**Title:** "The Governance Gap — 3-Minute Survey"
**Intro text:**
> I'm exploring whether there's demand for a new kind of governance tool — one that's AI-native, built specifically for portfolio & programme governance, and priced for mid-market organisations (not £50K+/year enterprise tools).
>
> Your answers will directly shape what gets built. 100% anonymous. Takes ~3 minutes.

## Execution Plan

| Step | Action | When |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Create Google Form | Today |
| 2 | Post Poll 1 on LinkedIn | Mon 3 Feb (weekday morning, peak engagement) |
| 3 | Post Poll 2 on LinkedIn | Thu 6 Feb |
| 4 | Post Poll 3 on LinkedIn | Mon 10 Feb |
| 5 | Share Google Form link in each poll's comments + as standalone post | Ongoing |
| 6 | Analyse results | Week of 17 Feb |
| 7 | Write up findings — validate/pivot Helm direction | 17-19 Feb |

## Tips for Maximum Reach
- Post between 7:30-8:30 AM GMT (LinkedIn peak for UK professionals)
- Reply to every comment — algorithm rewards conversation
- Tag specific people you know in the PMO space (but don't over-tag)
- Share to relevant LinkedIn groups (PMO, Programme Management, Governance)
- Cross-post abbreviated version to any relevant Slack/Discord communities
- Consider tagging AXELOS, APM, or PMI — they sometimes amplify governance content

## Target Responses
- **Polls:** 50-100+ votes each (achievable with Bry's network + hashtag reach)
- **Survey:** 20-30 completed responses (enough for directional validation)
- **Beta interest:** 5-10 people expressing early access interest = strong validation signal
