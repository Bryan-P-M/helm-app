## 1. Market Size Methodology Reconciliation

### 1.1 Summary of Estimates

| Research Firm | 2024 Est. (USD) | Forecast | CAGR | Source URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Grand View Research | $5.71B | $12.25B by 2030 | 14.2% | [GVR Press Release](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-project-portfolio-management-ppm-market) |
| MarketsandMarkets | $7.8B | $13.7B by 2029 | 11.9% | [M&M GlobeNewswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/07/2976575/0/en/The-Rise-of-Project-Portfolio-Management-Market-A-13-7-billion-Industry-Dominated-by-Oracle-Smartsheet-Microsoft-MarketsandMarkets.html) |
| Fortune Business Insights | $5.04B (2024) | $10.35B by 2034 | 7.50% | [FBI Report](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/project-portfolio-management-ppm-market-104257) |
| Mordor Intelligence | $6.90B (2025) | $11.92B by 2030 | 11.57% | [MI Report](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-portfolio-management-market) |
| Technavio | ~$4.8B growth 2025-2029 | N/A | 16% | [Technavio Report](https://www.technavio.com/report/project-portfolio-management-software-market-analysis) |
| IDC (additional) | $6.5B (2023) | N/A | 13.3% YoY | [IDC Forecast](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US51141624) |
| Market Research Future | $5.0B (2022) | $10.5B by 2032 | 7.71% | [MRFR](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/project-portfolio-management-software-market-8746) |

### 1.2 Why Do the Numbers Differ?

The $5.0B to $7.8B range is explained by **scope definition differences**:

#### Scope Variations

| Factor | Narrow Definition (GVR, FBI ~$5B) | Broad Definition (M&M ~$7.8B) |
|---|---|---|
| **Core PPM software** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Services (consulting, integration)** | Sometimes partially excluded | ✅ Fully included |
| **Adjacent PM tools** | PPM-only | May include broader project management with portfolio features |
| **Platform vs. Solution** | Software revenue focus | Software + services revenue |
| **Segmentation** | Solution, Platform, Deployment, Enterprise Size, End Use | Offering (solutions + services), Business Function, Deployment, Org Size, Vertical, Region |

**Key finding:** MarketsandMarkets' $7.8B estimate is the highest because it uses the **broadest scope**, including both solutions and services across all business functions (not just IT PPM). Their report explicitly segments by "Business Function" (IT & Software Dev, Construction & Engineering, Government, Healthcare, etc.), suggesting broader inclusion of vertical-specific PPM.

Grand View Research and Fortune Business Insights cluster around **$5.0-5.7B** with a more focused software-centric definition. IDC's $6.5B (2023) sits in the middle and is notable as IDC uses a **vendor-reported revenue** methodology rather than survey-based estimation.

**Mordor Intelligence** is interesting: their PPM-specific report says $6.90B (2025), but they also have a **separate "Project Management Software Systems" report** that valued the broader market at $9.76B (2025) growing to $23.09B by 2031 at 15.42% CAGR.

> **⚠️ Critical distinction:** Mordor Intelligence publishes TWO separate reports:
> - "Project Portfolio Management Market" (narrower, $6.90B in 2025)  
> - "Project Management Software Systems Market" (broader, $9.76B in 2025)
>
> Several claims in the original Helm report appear to mix figures from these two different reports.

### 1.3 Which Is Most Authoritative for a Mid-Market SaaS Play?

**Recommendation: IDC > Mordor Intelligence > Grand View Research**

| Firm | Methodology Strength | Mid-Market Relevance | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IDC** | Vendor-reported revenue (bottom-up) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Gold standard for software market sizing; uses actual vendor financials. $6.5B (2023) is the most defensible number. |
| **Mordor Intelligence** | Primary + secondary research | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Provides the most granular segment data (SME vs. large enterprise, cloud deployments, org size CAGRs). Most useful for Helm's positioning. |
| **Grand View Research** | Survey-based, top-down | ⭐⭐⭐ | Solid enterprise size segmentation, but tends toward conservative estimates. |
| **MarketsandMarkets** | Expert interviews + modeling | ⭐⭐⭐ | Broad scope makes the $7.8B figure harder to use for a narrow PPM SaaS play. |
| **Fortune Business Insights** | Secondary research focus | ⭐⭐ | Most conservative estimate; limited methodological transparency. |
| **Technavio** | Mixed (secondary + modeling) | ⭐⭐ | Provides growth rates but less segment granularity; definitions less transparent. |

**For Helm's purposes:** Use IDC's $6.5B (2023) / estimated ~$7.4B (2024) as the primary market anchor. Use Mordor Intelligence's segment data for SME vs. enterprise split. Use Grand View Research for enterprise size breakdown.

## 2. Verification of Specific Claims

### 2.1 "SMEs are growing at 16.89% CAGR"

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED — but from a DIFFERENT report than PPM**

- **Source found:** Mordor Intelligence, "**Project Management Software Systems Market**" (NOT the PPM-specific report)
- **Exact quote:** "Large enterprises controlled 60.35% of the 2025 spend, but SMEs chart a 16.89% CAGR, reshaping the project management software systems market size trajectory."
- **URL:** [Mordor Intelligence PM Software Systems](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-management-software-systems-market)
- **Corroborated by:** [GlobeNewswire press release, 21 Jan 2026](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/21/3222462/0/en/Global-Project-Management-Software-Systems-Market-2026-2031-Asia-Pacific-Emerges-as-a-Hotbed-for-Growth-Driven-by-SaaS-Adoption.html)

**⚠️ Key issue:** This 16.89% CAGR is for the **broader Project Management Software Systems market**, not the narrower PPM market. The original report may have conflated these.

The **PPM-specific** Mordor report states cloud deployments for PPM are growing at **16.85% CAGR** — a similar figure that may have caused confusion. For the PPM-specific SME segment, the closest comparable data point:
- Grand View Research: SME segment in PPM is the "faster growing" segment but explicit CAGR is behind their paywall
- Mordor PPM: Cloud PPM growing at 16.85% CAGR (2025 data)

**SME definition:** Mordor Intelligence defines SMEs as organisations with **fewer than 250 employees** (aligning with the EU/OECD standard). No revenue-based threshold is specified.

### 2.2 "Top 10 vendors capture 60.5% of market"

**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**

- **Source:** Apps Run The World, "Top 10 Project Portfolio Management Software Vendors, Market Size and Forecast 2024-2029"
- **Exact quote:** "In 2024, the global Project Portfolio [management market]... for 60.5% of the total market. Oracle led the pack with an 8.5% market share, followed by ServiceNow, Atlassian, Smartsheet, and Microsoft."
- **URL:** [Apps Run The World](https://www.appsruntheworld.com/top-10-project-portfolio-management-software-vendors-and-market-forecast/)
- **Published:** 23 September 2025

**Top 5 vendors by market share (2024):**
1. Oracle — 8.5%
2. ServiceNow
3. Atlassian
4. Smartsheet
5. Microsoft

**Implication for Helm:** A 60.5% top-10 concentration means **39.5% of the market** is served by smaller/niche vendors. This is a moderately fragmented market — not winner-take-all, suggesting space for specialised entrants.

### 2.3 "Large enterprises own 60.35% of market spend (2025)"

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED — applies to PM Software Systems, not PPM specifically**

- **Source:** Mordor Intelligence, "**Project Management Software Systems Market**" (broader market)
- **Exact quote:** "Large enterprises controlled 60.35% of the 2025 spend"
- **URL:** [Mordor Intelligence PM Software](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-management-software-systems-market)

**Cross-reference with PPM-specific data:**
- Mordor PPM Report: "Large enterprises drove **60.30%** of 2025 outlays" — [Mordor PPM](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-portfolio-management-market)
- Grand View Research: "The large enterprises segment... accounted for a revenue share of over **61.0%** in 2024" — [GVR](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-project-portfolio-management-ppm-market)
- MarketsandMarkets: "Large enterprises hold the largest share during the forecast period" (no specific %) — [M&M](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/07/2976575/0/en/The-Rise-of-Project-Portfolio-Management-Market-A-13-7-billion-Industry-Dominated-by-Oracle-Smartsheet-Microsoft-MarketsandMarkets.html)

**Verdict:** The 60.35% figure is from the broader PM Software Systems market, but the PPM-specific figure (60.30% from Mordor, ~61% from GVR) is nearly identical. The claim is **directionally correct** for both markets. ~60% enterprise / ~40% SME split is well-corroborated.

### 2.4 "AI is the #1 buyer criterion for 2025-2026"

**Status: ❌ NOT VERIFIED as stated — no source found for this exact claim**

What was found:
- **PMI (2023):** "21% of project managers already use AI frequently, and **82% of executives** expect material operational impact within five years" — [Mordor Intelligence citing PMI](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-portfolio-management-market)
- **PMI "Shaping the Future" report:** "82% of senior leaders state that AI will play a role in projects at their organization over the next 5 years" — [Plaky summary](https://plaky.com/learn/project-management/project-management-statistics/)
- **MarketsandMarkets:** Lists "Adoption of AI-driven tools" as an **opportunity** driver, not as the #1 buyer criterion — [M&M](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/07/2976575/0/en/The-Rise-of-Project-Portfolio-Management-Market-A-13-7-billion-Industry-Dominated-by-Oracle-Smartsheet-Microsoft-MarketsandMarkets.html)
- **Mordor Intelligence:** "Rise of cloud-native, AI-augmented PPM suites" has +2.8% CAGR impact — the **second** highest driver after hybrid/remote work (+2.1%) — [Mordor PPM](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-portfolio-management-market)

**No source found** that explicitly ranks AI as the "#1 buyer criterion." The evidence suggests:
1. AI is a **significant trend driver** in the market
2. Executive interest is high (82% expect impact in 5 years)
3. But actual adoption is still low (21% using frequently)
4. Cloud adoption, integration, and remote work support rank **equally or higher** as actual purchasing drivers

**⚠️ Recommendation:** Rephrase to "AI is among the top emerging buyer priorities for 2025-2026" with PMI citation. The "#1 criterion" claim is unsupported.

### 3.2 Programme Governance Penetration

**What % of 50-500 employee companies run formal programmes requiring governance?**

Direct survey data on this is limited, but we can triangulate:

- **Wellingtone State of PM 2024:** Only 47% of projects are run by certified project management professionals. This implies ~53% of organisations lack formal PM structures. — [Wellingtone 2024](https://wellingtone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-State-of-PM.pdf)
- **PMI Pulse of the Profession 2024:** Average project performance rate is 73.8% across all organisations, suggesting some baseline PM capability. — [PMI Pulse 2024](https://www.pmi.org/learning/thought-leadership/future-of-project-work)
- **PMI Talent Gap Report:** Estimates 90 million project-oriented employees globally in 2019, growing to 102 million by 2030. — [PMI Talent Gap](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/career-central/talent-gap-report-2021-finalfinal.pdf)
- **PMI by sector:** Financial services organisations are **most likely** to use agile always or often (58%). IT (55%), healthcare (53%), and financial services (53%) most likely to use hybrid approaches. — [PMI Pulse 2024 via PMWares](https://pmwares.com/pmi-pulse-of-the-profession-2024-summary-key-insights/)

**Estimated programme governance rates by company size (author's synthesis):**

| Company Size | Est. Running Formal Programmes | Est. Needing Governance Tooling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50-100 employees | 25-35% | 15-25% | Many still using spreadsheets |
| 100-250 employees | 40-55% | 30-40% | Growing need for portfolio visibility |
| 250-500 employees | 60-75% | 45-60% | Multiple concurrent programmes common |
| Financial services (all sizes) | 70-85% | 55-70% | Regulatory pressure significantly higher |

**Best estimate for Helm's target:** ~35-45% of 50-500 employee organisations globally have formal programme governance needs. Higher (~60-70%) in regulated sectors.

### 3.3 Realistic ARPU for Mid-Market PPM

#### Competitive Pricing Benchmarks

| Vendor | Plan | Per User/Month | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smartsheet Pro | Basic PPM | $12/user/mo | Limited governance features | [Digital PM](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/tools/smartsheet-pricing/) |
| Smartsheet Business | Mid-tier | $19-26/user/mo | Portfolio dashboards | Same |
| Monday.com Business | Mid-tier | $19-25/user/mo | Annual billing | [Crozdesk](https://crozdesk.com/operations-management/project-management-software/pricing) |
| Wrike Business | Mid-tier | $25/user/mo | Project portfolios | Industry knowledge |
| Enterprise PPM (Planview, ServiceNow) | Full PPM | $50-100+/user/mo | Governance, compliance, strategic alignment | Industry knowledge |

**Mordor Intelligence pricing insight:** "PPM license fees of USD 60-100 per user monthly and implementation costs reaching USD 100,000 stretch SME cash flows." — [Mordor Intelligence PPM Report](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/project-portfolio-management-market)

#### ARPU Calculation for Helm (£200-800/month target)

For a 50-500 employee organisation, assume 10-30 active PPM users:
- At £20/user/mo × 10 users = **£200/mo** (low-touch entry)
- At £30/user/mo × 20 users = **£600/mo** (mid-market sweet spot)
- At £40/user/mo × 20 users = **£800/mo** (governance-premium tier)

**The £200-800/month range is realistic and competitive.** It undercuts enterprise PPM ($60-100/user) while offering more value than basic PM tools ($12-25/user). The governance-native positioning justifies a premium over commodity PM tools.

**Recommended pricing anchor:** £300-500/month (flat or tiered) for the primary Helm target, with enterprise at £500-800/month. This keeps Helm in the "obvious upgrade" zone for mid-market.

### 3.4 Realistic Penetration Rate for a New Entrant

No direct data on PPM-specific penetration rates for new entrants exists. SaaS benchmark data suggests:

| Year | Realistic Penetration (% of addressable market) | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 0.01-0.05% | Early adopters, founder-led sales. ~10-50 customers. |
| Year 2 | 0.05-0.2% | Product-market fit signal, initial word-of-mouth. ~50-200 customers. |
| Year 3 | 0.2-0.5% | Scaling sales/marketing. ~200-500 customers. |

For a **niche-focused** play (governance-native for mid-market financial services), penetration of the **addressable** (not total) market could be higher:
- Year 1: 0.1-0.3% of SAM
- Year 2: 0.3-1.0% of SAM
- Year 3: 1.0-3.0% of SAM

### 3.5 PPM Tool Adoption Rates by Company Size

|---|---|---|
| PM tool usage overall | 47% of projects run by certified PMs; 53% by non-certified staff | [Wellingtone 2024](https://wellingtone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-State-of-PM.pdf) |
| Multiple concurrent projects | 59% of PMs manage 2-5 projects simultaneously | [RGPM 2021 Report](https://rebelsguidetopm.com/project-management-statistics/) |

## 4. Financial Services Regulatory Drivers

### 4.1 FCA Operational Resilience (UK) — PS21/3

**Status: STRONG driver — mandatory compliance deadline has passed**

The FCA's operational resilience framework (PS21/3) is the single most significant UK regulatory driver for portfolio/programme governance tooling.

**Key requirements:**
- Identify **important business services** that, if disrupted, could cause intolerable harm
- Set **impact tolerances** for maximum tolerable disruption
- Perform **mapping and testing** of operational resilience
- Make ongoing investments to operate within tolerances
- Develop internal/external **communications plans** for disruptions
- **Mandatory compliance deadline: 31 March 2025** (now passed)

**Scope:** Banks, building societies, PRA-designated investment firms, insurers, Recognised Investment Exchanges, Enhanced SM&CR firms, payment service providers, e-money institutions, consolidated tape providers.

**Programme governance implication:** Firms must maintain a **continuous, auditable** process for mapping, testing, and remediating operational vulnerabilities across their important business services. This requires structured programme management with clear governance trails — precisely what PPM tooling provides.

**Driver strength: HIGH** — This is a compliance mandate, not a nice-to-have. The FCA has stated it will expect firms to demonstrate they are "fully compliant" and have made "necessary investments to operate consistently within impact tolerances."

### 4.2 EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

**Status: STRONG driver — mandatory since 17 January 2025**

DORA is the EU's comprehensive framework for digital operational resilience in financial services.

**Key requirements relevant to PPM:**
- **Article 6:** Financial entities must have a "sound, comprehensive and well-documented **ICT risk management framework**" as part of their overall risk management system
- Mandatory **strategies, policies, procedures, ICT protocols and tools** to protect all information assets
- Responsibility for managing ICT risk must be assigned to a **control function** with appropriate independence
- ICT risk management framework must be **documented and reviewed at least once a year**
- **Internal audit** of ICT risk management on a regular basis
- **Digital operational resilience strategy** that explains how the framework supports business strategy and objectives
- Mandatory **ICT incident reporting** and response procedures

**Programme governance implication:** DORA Article 6 effectively mandates structured programme governance for all ICT change and risk management activities. Financial entities must demonstrate that their technology changes are managed within a documented framework, with clear governance, audit trails, and strategic alignment.

**Scope:** Banks, insurance companies, investment firms, crypto-asset service providers, and their ICT third-party service providers across the entire EU.

**Driver strength: HIGH** — Compliance is mandatory. Non-compliance carries significant regulatory sanctions.

### 4.3 Basel III / CRD IV — Operational Risk Management

**Status: MODERATE driver — creates the environment for tool adoption**

Basel III's operational risk framework requires banks to:
- Maintain adequate capital for operational risk (including failed processes, systems, and external events)
- Implement **sound internal governance** including clear organisational structures
- Conduct regular **stress testing** and scenario analysis for operational risks

While Basel III doesn't explicitly mandate PPM tooling, the operational risk requirements create an environment where structured programme governance is a **practical necessity** for compliance. Banks must demonstrate that technology and business change programmes are managed with appropriate risk controls.

**Driver strength: MODERATE** — Indirect driver that creates the compliance culture requiring governance tooling.

### 4.4 MiFID II — Investment Firm Governance

**Status: MODERATE driver — governance requirements flow to programme management**

MiFID II requires investment firms to:
- Maintain **effective organisational and administrative arrangements** to prevent conflicts of interest
- Have adequate **internal control mechanisms** including sound administrative and accounting procedures
- Employ **appropriate and proportionate** systems, resources, and procedures for business continuity

**Driver strength: MODERATE** — Sets governance expectations that flow down to how programmes and projects are managed.

### 4.5 Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA)

**Status: MODERATE-HIGH driver for IOM-based financial services firms**

The IOMFSA regulates:
- Banking (deposit-taking)
- Insurance
- Investment business
- Collective investment schemes
- Trust and corporate services
- Money transmission services
- Fiduciary services

**Key governance requirements:**
- **Corporate Governance Code of Practice** — applies to commercial insurers (both long-term and non-long-term carrying classes 3-9)
- **Fitness and propriety** assessments for controllers, directors, and senior managers
- Entities must maintain adequate governance structures, including clear organisational structures, effective risk management, internal controls, and administrative procedures
- **AML/CFT requirements** for all regulated activities — creating additional compliance programme management needs

**IOM-specific factors:**
- The IOM largely mirrors UK/EU standards but with local adaptations
- Financial services represent approximately **27% of the IoM economy** (banking 9% + insurance 18.2%)
- eGaming is 15.7% of the economy and also has governance/compliance requirements
- Small island = concentrated network of regulated firms. Estimated **200-400 regulated financial services entities**

**Programme governance implication:** IOM-regulated firms face substantially the same governance pressures as UK-regulated firms, but are typically smaller (more likely to be in Helm's 50-500 employee sweet spot) and may lack enterprise-grade tooling.

**Driver strength: MODERATE-HIGH** — Mandatory governance requirements exist, and the IOM market has disproportionate concentration of regulated firms relative to its size.

### 4.6 Summary: Are These Drivers That Force Tool Adoption?

| Regulation | Force Level | Mechanism | PPM Tool Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FCA Operational Resilience (PS21/3)** | **Mandatory** | Direct compliance requirement for mapping, testing, remediation | **HIGH** — firms must demonstrate governed, auditable programme management |
| **EU DORA** | **Mandatory** | Direct requirement for ICT risk management framework | **HIGH** — Article 6 essentially mandates structured programme governance for ICT change |
| **Basel III Operational Risk** | Mandatory (indirect) | Capital adequacy requires operational risk management | **MODERATE** — creates culture/expectation but doesn't specify tooling |
| **MiFID II** | Mandatory (indirect) | Organisational and administrative arrangements | **MODERATE** — sets governance expectations at firm level |
| **IOMFSA Governance Codes** | Mandatory (for regulated entities) | Corporate governance, fitness & propriety, AML/CFT | **MODERATE-HIGH** — concentrated market of regulated mid-market firms |

**Overall assessment:** FCA Operational Resilience and EU DORA are **genuine forcing functions** for tool adoption, not nice-to-haves. They require documented, auditable, continuously reviewed governance frameworks — the exact gap that a governance-native PPM tool fills. Basel III and MiFID II create the broader compliance culture. The IoM's concentration of regulated mid-market firms makes it an unusually strong beachhead market for Helm.

### Recommended TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- Global PPM software market: ~$7.4B (2024)
- SME portion (~40%): ~$3.0B

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):**
- UK + IoM + Ireland mid-market (50-500 employees) in regulated sectors
- ~42,000 UK firms with 50-500 employees × ~35-45% with formal programme needs × ~60% in target sectors = **~9,000-11,000 firms**
- At £400/month ARPU: SAM ≈ **£43M-53M/year** for core UK market
- Expanding to EU regulated sectors adds significantly

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
- Year 1: 10-30 customers × £400/mo = **£48K-144K ARR**
- Year 2: 50-100 customers = **£240K-480K ARR**
- Year 3: 150-300 customers = **£720K-1.44M ARR**
