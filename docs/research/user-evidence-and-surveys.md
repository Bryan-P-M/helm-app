## 1. User Review Mining: Complaints by Theme

### 1.1 Lack of Portfolio/Programme-Level Visibility

| # | Tool | Quote / Finding | Source |

## 2. PMO Industry Surveys

### 2.1 PMI Pulse of the Profession 2025

**Source:** [PMI Pulse of the Profession 2025](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse_of_the_profession_2025-1.pdf) — Survey of ~2,841 project professionals globally.

**Key Findings:**

| Metric | Statistic |
|--------|-----------|
| Projects meeting business goals (high business acumen) | 83% vs 78% (low acumen) |
| Budget adherence (high acumen) | 73% vs 68% |
| Schedule adherence (high acumen) | 63% vs 59% |
| Project failure rate (high acumen) | 8% vs 11% |
| Project professionals with high business acumen | Only **18%** |
| PMs with extensive/good practical AI skills | Only **~20%** |
| % who believe business acumen aids strategic decision-making | 77% |
| % who believe it helps risk management | 62% |
| % who believe it helps navigate regulatory/compliance | 40% |
| Training hours allocated to business acumen | Only **25%** (vs 46% technical) |

**Relevance to Helm:** The gap between governance maturity and tool capability is enormous. Only 18% of PMs demonstrate high business acumen, yet high-acumen PMs have 27% lower failure rates. Tools that embed governance workflows can help bridge this gap for the other 82%.

### 2.2 Wellingtone State of Project Management 2025

**Source:** [Wellingtone — State of Project Management 2025](https://wellingtone.co.uk/publications/state-of-project-management-research/) — Hundreds of UK and international PPM practitioners.

**Key Findings:**

| Metric | Statistic |
|--------|-----------|
| Dissatisfied with PM maturity | **46%** somewhat or very dissatisfied |
| Satisfied with PM maturity | Only **37%** |
| Most challenging processes to embed | Benefits Realisation, Resource Management, **Project Prioritisation** |
| PMO scope expected to grow | **72%** |
| Spend 1+ days manually collating reports | **42%** |
| Apply a defined project methodology | 59% mostly/always |
| Create a scoping document in planning | 53% mostly/always |
| Actively use a project schedule | 68% mostly/always |
| Engage in risk management | 65% mostly/always |
| Complete projects on time | Only **38%** mostly/always |
| Complete projects on budget | Only **41%** mostly/always |
| Deliver full project benefits | Only **39%** mostly/always |
| Organisations with no PM solution at all | **11%** |
| Still planning with Excel | **14%** |
| Organisations with ≥1 PMO | **89%** (82% per 2024 data) |
| PMOs less than 4 years old | Nearly **50%** |
| Do not have access to real-time KPIs | **~50%** |
| PMOs with clear remit & objectives | 53% |
| PMOs with defined catalogue of services | 40% |

**Relevance to Helm:** 46% dissatisfaction with PM maturity + 42% spending a full day manually collating reports + 50% without real-time KPIs = massive opportunity for a tool that automates governance reporting and provides real-time portfolio visibility.

### 2.5 AI Adoption in Project Management

| Metric | Statistic | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| PMs already using AI for projects | **51%** | [Xergy/Proteus compilation](https://xergy.com/proteus-blog/the-state-of-project-management-in-2025/) |
| PMs reporting positive ROI from AI investment | **90%** | Same |
| Plans to increase AI investment | **36%** increase | Same |
| PMOs expected to use AI for decision-making by 2026 | **80%** | [Gartner via PM Study Circle](https://pmstudycircle.com/project-management-statistics/) |
| Senior leaders planning AI role in projects (5-year horizon) | **82%** | [PMI — Shaping the Future of PM with AI](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/shaping-the-future-of-project-management-with-ai.pdf) |
| PMs with extensive/good practical AI skills | Only **~20%** | [PMI Pulse 2025](https://instituteprojectmanagement.com/blog/pulse-of-the-profession-report/) |
| Main barrier to AI adoption | Resistance to change (26%), lack of skilled personnel (19%), data quality (17%), cost (15%) | [Xergy compilation](https://xergy.com/proteus-blog/the-state-of-project-management-in-2025/) |

**Relevance to Helm:** 82% of senior leaders want AI in projects, but only 20% of PMs have the skills. A tool with AI built in (not bolted on) has a massive adoption advantage. AI that automates governance reporting, risk flagging, and decision logging could address the #1 barrier (resistance to change) by making governance effortless.

### 2.6 The PMO Adoption vs Satisfaction Paradox

This data point is critical for Helm's positioning:

- **82%** of organisations have a PMO ([Wellingtone 2025](https://wellingtone.co.uk/publications/state-of-project-management-research/))
- But only **37%** are satisfied with their PM maturity ([Wellingtone 2025](https://wellingtone.co.uk/publications/state-of-project-management-research/))
- PMO investment plans **dropped from 57% to 38%** year-over-year ([Wellingtone 2024](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/project-management-statistics/))
- **25%** of PMOs are less than 2 years old — organisations are actively experimenting with new models ([Wellingtone 2025](https://wellingtone.co.uk/publications/state-of-project-management-research/))
- Organisations waste **$1 million every 20 seconds** due to poor project management — ~$2 trillion annually ([Voyage Advisory analysis](https://www.voyageadvisory.com/news-articles/building-better-governance-a-utilitys-project-management-transformation))
- Organisations with mature PM achieve **92% success rates** vs **33%** for immature ones ([Same](https://www.voyageadvisory.com/news-articles/building-better-governance-a-utilitys-project-management-transformation))

**Interpretation:** Organisations aren't abandoning governance — they're abandoning *traditional* governance. They want lighter, smarter, risk-based governance that actually delivers. This is exactly where Helm fits.

## 3. Analyst Reports: Gartner & Forrester

### 3.1 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Portfolio Management (2025)

**Report:** [2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SPM](https://bizzdesign.com/analyst-report/gartner-magic-quadrant-strategic-portfolio-management-2025) — Published August 2025 by John Spaeth, Shailesh Muvera, Peter Clegg, Faisel Pervaiz, Daniel Stang.

**Gartner Market Definition (from Peer Insights):**

> "The dynamic and complex multiple organizational operating model design of all organizations makes the correct governance approach imperative, yet difficult to achieve."
>
> — [Gartner Peer Insights — Adaptive Project Management and Reporting](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/adaptive-project-management-and-reporting)

**Key Gartner Findings:**

- **SPM vendors** evaluated include Planview (Leader), Broadcom/Clarity (Leader), Bizzdesign/Alfabet (Leader), and others
- The market focuses on "facilitating long-term planning, medium-term prioritization, and short-term funding execution" ([Gartner Peer Insights — SPM Market](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/strategic-portfolio-management))
- Gartner identifies **budget restrictions and talent shortages** as key difficulties in identifying right SPM investments ([Gartner — PPM Leaders](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/role/program-portfolio-management-leaders))
- **Top trends for PPM leaders in 2025:** technology rationalisation, financial scrutiny, and talent gaps ([Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6533602))

**Mid-Market Gap:** The Magic Quadrant Leaders (Planview, Broadcom, Bizzdesign) are all **enterprise-grade** solutions with enterprise-grade pricing. Gartner's separate category for "Adaptive Project Management and Reporting" recognises that lighter-weight tools exist but explicitly notes governance remains "imperative, yet difficult to achieve" with these tools. The mid-market (50-500 employees) falls between the two categories — too complex for task managers, priced out of enterprise SPM.

### 3.2 Forrester Wave: Strategic Portfolio Management Tools, Q2 2024

**Report:** [The Forrester Wave™: Strategic Portfolio Management Tools, Q2 2024](https://www.forrester.com/report/the-forrester-wave-tm-strategic-portfolio-management-tools-q2-2024/RES180733)

**Key Findings:**

- Evaluated **12 providers** against 22 criteria
- **Broadcom (Clarity)** — Leader: "differentiates by focusing on investment strategies and teams. Recognising that most customers are hybrid, Broadcom took restrictive PPM planning requirements off the table to allow organisations to look at investments and capacity constraints first" ([Broadcom announcement](https://academy.broadcom.com/blog/valueops/broadcom-named-a-leader-in-forrester-wave-strategic-portfolio-management-report))
- **Planview** — Leader per Forrester, also Leader per Gartner MQ 2024 and 2025 ([WinMill PPM](https://winmillppm.com/blog/planview-forrester-wave-leader-2024))
- **Smartsheet** — positioned as "most portfolio-ready player to compete with PPM and SPM vendors" in the CWM (Collaborative Work Management) Wave, but notably in a *different category* than SPM — acknowledging it's not yet a true SPM tool ([Smartsheet — Forrester Wave](https://www.smartsheet.com/forrester/2022-Wave))

**Historical Forrester Finding (still relevant):**

> "Traditional PPM doesn't suit the lighter-weight/Lean governance processes that Agile projects require. Organisations that fail to adopt governance processes that span traditional waterfall and Agile will struggle."
>
> — [Forrester Wave: Project/Program Portfolio Management](https://www.forrester.com/report/The-Forrester-Wave-ProjectProgram-Portfolio-Management-Q4-2012/RES61657)

### 3.3 Analyst Consensus: Unmet Needs in Mid-Market PPM

Based on the analyst reports and market data, the following gaps emerge for mid-market organisations (50-500 employees):

| Gap | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| **Governance is imperative but difficult** | Gartner Peer Insights market definition explicitly states governance is "imperative, yet difficult to achieve" with current tools |
| **Enterprise SPM is too heavy/expensive** | Gartner MQ leaders (Planview, Broadcom) target large enterprises; mid-market can't justify the cost or complexity |
| **Work management tools lack governance** | Forrester places Smartsheet in CWM, not SPM — it competes but isn't designed for governance |
| **Hybrid methodology support is non-negotiable** | Forrester notes PPM must span waterfall and Agile; 57% increase in hybrid adoption (PMI 2024) |
| **AI integration is expected** | Gartner expects 80% of PMOs to use AI by 2026; current tools have basic/bolt-on AI |
| **Resource management is the #1 gap** | 40% of PMs say it's their biggest challenge; most mid-market tools handle it poorly |
| **Decision velocity matters** | Projects with leadership decisions <1 hour achieve 58% success rates vs much lower when decisions lag |

**Mid-Market Opportunity:** With large enterprises commanding 61% of spend, and the market growing at 11-12% CAGR, the remaining 39% (~$2.7B in 2025) serves SMB and mid-market. This segment is underserved by enterprise-grade SPM tools and over-served by lightweight task managers. Smaller businesses are 13% *more* likely to adopt PM tools, signalling demand but dissatisfaction with existing options.

---

## 5. Synthesis: The Mid-Market Governance Gap

### The Core Problem

The evidence points to a clear and quantifiable gap:

1. **82% of organisations have a PMO**, but only **37% are satisfied** with their PM maturity
2. **42% spend a full day manually collating reports** — governance is manual labour, not automated insight
3. **50% don't have access to real-time KPIs** — decision-makers are flying blind
4. **Only 38% complete projects on time**, **41% on budget**, **39% deliver full benefits**
5. **46% of practitioners are dissatisfied** with their organisation's PM maturity
6. The most challenging processes to embed are **Benefits Realisation, Resource Management, and Project Prioritisation** — all governance functions

### The Opportunity for Helm

The market data paints a clear picture:

- **$6.9B market** growing at **11.9% CAGR** — significant and expanding
- **Mid-market is underserved** — enterprise SPM is too expensive, task managers are too light
- **Governance is the gap** — every industry survey identifies it as critical but poorly tooled
- **AI is the differentiator** — 82% of leaders want it, 80% of PMOs will need it by 2026, but only 20% of PMs have the skills today
- **PMOs are young and experimenting** — 50% are less than 4 years old, actively seeking better models
- **Manual reporting is killing productivity** — 42% spend full days on it; automation is an immediate win

A governance-first PPM tool for mid-market organisations — with built-in RAID, decision logging, automated reporting, and AI-powered insights — addresses a gap that no current mid-market tool fills.
