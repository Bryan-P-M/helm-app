# Objectives

## Problem Statement

Organisations invest heavily in change—programmes and projects designed to deliver strategic outcomes, operational improvements, and competitive advantage. Yet the governance frameworks meant to oversee this investment are failing.

**Information is fragmented.** RAID logs exist in isolated spreadsheets. Actions agreed in governance meetings are lost in email threads or buried in unread minutes. Each project tracks its own risks and issues with no consolidation upward. There is no single source of truth.

**Accountability is unclear.** When deliverables slip or decisions stall, ownership is ambiguous. Multiple people assume someone else is responsible. Escalation pathways exist on paper but not in practice. Governance forums spend more time establishing "who owns this" than resolving the issue.

**Earned value is invisible.** Without consistent, reliable tracking of cost and expenditure against delivered benefits and agreed schedules, governance forums cannot make timely interventions. They lack the data to correct course, adjust scope, or discontinue failing initiatives before avoidable time and cost disbenefits accumulate.

**The tools don't fit.** Existing solutions—Excel, ServiceNow, Planview, MS Project—either lack governance-specific capability, don't scale across portfolio/programme/project tiers, or fail to connect oversight with execution. PMO teams spend days before each board manually consolidating data from disparate systems, only to present information that's already out of date.

**The cost is strategic.** At the operational level, PMO leads drown in manual work and firefighting. At the tactical level, programme sponsors and portfolio directors cannot trust the numbers and are routinely surprised by bad news. At the strategic level, the C-suite loses the ability to reliably adjust and adapt to changing demands and operating environment. The business loses confidence in the change function's capability to deliver. Ultimately, the consequences are severe: in the private sector, competitive disadvantage—outpaced by competitors who can execute change effectively; in the public sector, degradation or failure of public services, wasted public funds, and erosion of citizen trust.

The problem is not a lack of governance frameworks. P3O, MSP, PRINCE2, and MoP provide robust guidance. The problem is that organisations lack the tooling to operationalise these frameworks consistently, connect governance to execution, and surface the information leaders need to make timely, evidence-based decisions.

## Vision

Helm provides portfolio, programme, and project governance that connects to an organisation's operational stack—delivering oversight, assurance, and action-driven management of change delivery.

Helm is the control surface for organisational change: a single platform where RAID items are tracked and escalated, governance decisions are captured and actioned, accountability is clear, performance is measured against strategic objectives, and leaders have the visibility to intervene before problems become crises.

## Goals

### Phase 1 Goal
Deliver a live landing page that clearly articulates the problem Helm solves, the capabilities it offers, and the value it provides to governance and delivery roles across portfolio, programme, and project tiers.

### Product Goals
1. **Single source of truth** — Centralise RAID, actions, decisions, and accountability across all governance tiers
2. **Governance-to-action pipeline** — Connect meeting decisions to tracked, owned, and reported actions
3. **Earned value visibility** — Enable timely intervention through consistent cost/benefit/schedule tracking
4. **Framework alignment** — Operationalise P3O, MSP, PRINCE2, and MoP principles in practical tooling
5. **Strategic traceability** — Link project delivery to programme objectives to portfolio strategy
6. **Timely insight** — Surface the right information to the right people before decisions become crises
